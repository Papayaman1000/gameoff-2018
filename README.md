# gameoff-2018
My entry for the 2018 GitHub GameOff. **Collaboration encouraged!**

## Changelog & Roadmap
### Initial (2018-10-19)
This is where it begins. The theme isn't being announced until November 1, and so I won't begin work proper on this project until then. However, I already know what language and library I'll be using (JS/Phaser), so I'll be using the time until then to get everything collected and keep a basic boilerplate. This is more or less a project seed here; firm plans won't begin until the theme is announced.

I can also use this to outline how some more technical aspects of the version control side will work. I'll be using a basic X.Y.Z format: X will change when backwards compatibility with any user-saveable features is no longer supported (i.e. scoring system or save file modifications); Y will change for smaller changes in features, graphics, and the like; and Z will change for bugfixes and other minor tweaks and adjustments to the look and circuitry (hotfixes), but not anything affecting the feel of the actual gameplay. And, of course, whenever one number changes, all subsequent numbers roll over to zero (e.g. 2.3.4 => 3.0.0).

Finally, I'm putting out an offer to join development. I intend this primarily as a fun/learning project for my own personal enrichment, but the very best way to learn is through practical experience on projects, especially with a developer of greater skill than oneself. As such, developers of all experience levels are invited to get in touch with me via my Discord (@Papayaman1000#6000) to collaborate!
